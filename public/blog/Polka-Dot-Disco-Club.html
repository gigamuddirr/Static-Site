        <h1>Polka Dot Disco Club: The inclusive club night you need to go to</h1>
<p>Picture this: you&#39;re in the club. You have a drink in hand. You&#39;re wearing your best going-out top. Hair is mussed. A light sheen of sweat on your skin. You&#39;re dancing, you&#39;re jumping, you&#39;re swaying. The music is good. Great, even. You look to the decks and the DJ is a man.</p>
<p>Now, there&#39;s nothing wrong with the DJ being a man. He&#39;s great, you&#39;re having the time of your life, you&#39;ll (vaguely) remember this night for months. But what if every club you visit only ever has men behind the decks? For a very long time, DJing has been a male-dominated industry, but in 2024 things are changing.</p>
<p><strong>DJing is becoming a more inclusive space</strong>, and it&#39;s in part due to groups like Polka Dot Disco Club (PDDC): a Glasgow based female and non-binary DJ collective turned event series. Looking to diversify Scotland&#39;s nightlife scene and create visibility and inclusion for DJs of all backgrounds, PDDC was started by twin sisters Frankie and Jozette who have shared a passion for music their whole lives.</p>
<p>We got the chance to visit the sisters up in Glasgow, attend one of their magical club nights, and catch up about their love of DJing and why they started Polka Dot Disco Club.</p>
